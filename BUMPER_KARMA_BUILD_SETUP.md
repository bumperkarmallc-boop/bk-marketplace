# Bumper Karma — Build Setup & Handoff Guide

This document defines the non-negotiable build steps, platform rules,
and creator onboarding flow for Bumper Karma.

It exists to ensure the platform is handed off, scaled, or extended
without breaking core values, flow order, or creator protections.


## Core Platform Philosophy

Bumper Karma is a creator-first platform designed to give people space
to express themselves without being forced into narrow categories,
templates, or approval-driven marketplaces.

Creators are not told what they must sell.
Instead, the platform signals what kinds of expression are welcome,
while protecting creative freedom and long-term platform integrity.


## Creator Setup Grace Period

All approved creators receive a mandatory 7-day setup grace period.
This is not a free trial.

During this grace period, creators may:
- Create their profile
- Upload content or products
- Set pricing
- Explore platform tools

During this grace period, creators may NOT:
- Publish public listings
- Process payments
- Be visible to customers

The purpose of the grace period is to provide space for intentional setup,
prevent hit-and-run sellers, reduce disputes, and protect both creators
and the platform.


## Creator Status Flow (Internal States)
